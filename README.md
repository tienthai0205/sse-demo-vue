# SSE demo Vue

This is a simple Vue.js project to test the SSE (Server-sent events) connection between the [Node.js server](https://github.com/tienthai0205/SSE-demo-backend) and the Vue.js frontend. 

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

*Note: Backend server also need to be running to test the SSE behaviour. Refer to the Node.js repo above to run the server

The table will automatically update if there are new events got POST to server
